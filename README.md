# Java-Trajectory-Project

I developed this interface project in Java. It had 5 different files for it. When the Applet is started the user will see two trajectories moving on the panel to the right. The top trajectory is initially in red, and the bottom trajectory is blue. The user is able to change the color for each trajectory by simply clicking on the "Color" button that is on the far left panel side. They are able to pick from the color chooser panel, so there are plenty of options to pick from. They both initially have a velocity of 50, and an angle of 45 degrees. The user is able to change both the velocities and angles for either trajectory. The way to change them is by using the JSlider. The velocities can be between 10 and 100, while the angles can be between 5 and 85. Clicking on the "Clear" button will clear the trajectory or trajectories for that section, as I mentioned earlier there are 2 sections of trajectories (one up and one down). After changing either the velocity, angle, or color of the trajectory you will be able to see your new trajectory after clicking on "Start". This was all done on Java using Eclipse IDE.
